# Java-Vector-Drawing
A vector drawing software created as part of a UI course. Key features:
- Toolar with fancy tools.
- The toolbar initially on the left-hand side can moved around to the top, bottom, <br> right or left sides of the frame, or alternatively undocked into a separate window.
- Files are saved and loaded with the `.drw` extension.
- Selecting an already selected shape will unselect it. This makes moving shapes a bit annoying, <br> but is necessary in the case that the canvas is full.
